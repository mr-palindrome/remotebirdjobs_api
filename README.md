# remotebirdjobs_api
 
## Inspiration
The quantity of job options, both distant and local, is enormous, but discovering them for a single person is quite tough. As a result, we created **Remote Bird Jobs**.

## What it does
Remote Bird Jobs is a REST API that scrapes hiring tweets or any other type of tweets from Twitter, making the process of finding a tweet a breeze. The current version is optimizedÂ for Twitter, but it can also be used on other websites. I created this for a hackathon and submitted it to devpost with my team. I created this with the goal of locating remote job opportunities on Twitter.

## What I learned
I learned to scrape tweets and creating a Rest API.
